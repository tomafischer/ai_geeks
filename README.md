# About AI Geeks
I always have been facinated with Math, Computer Science and especially **Data**. 

Statistics and Machine Learning was always part of my work and with the rise of deep learning I found a new passion. 

The intent of this repo is to collect snippets, links and smaller analytics projects to share back with the world. Most of the content is based on blogs, documentations and classes I found over the years.
