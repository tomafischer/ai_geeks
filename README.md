# About AI Geeks
I always have been facinated with Math, Computer Science and especially **Data**. 

Statistics and Machine Learning was always part of my work and with the rise of deep learning I found a new passion. 

The intent of this repo is to collect snippets, links and smaller analytics projects to share back with the world. Most of the content is based on blogs, documentations and classes I found over the years.

# How I work
I used a lot of languages and tools in my 20+ years. 

Here is what I am using these days:
- Source control: Github
- Language: Python
- Python environments: Anaconda and Docker container locally
- Prototyping: Visual Studio Code, Google Colabs, Jupyter notebooks

## Practical intro to Deep Learning in 30 minute
I put together a teaching class as intro to Deep learning and pytorch.

## Helper Tools
### Markdown guides  
[Colab Markdown](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/markdown_guide.ipynb#scrollTo=Lhfnlq1Surtk)


# Datasets
[Mocked Data Generator](https://mockaroo.com/)
## Repositories
[Seaborn datasets](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data) are very easy to use for testing:

```python
import seaborn as sns
cars_pd= sns.load_dataset('mpg')
```
